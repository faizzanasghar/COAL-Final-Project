🎮 Atari Breakout – Assembly Language

A low-level implementation of the classic Atari Breakout game developed entirely in x86 Assembly language. This project recreates the core arcade mechanics using direct memory manipulation, CPU registers, and interrupt-based input/output handling.

🕹️ Game Overview

The player controls a paddle to bounce a moving ball and destroy bricks arranged in rows. The objective is to clear all bricks without letting the ball fall below the paddle.

✨ Features

Keyboard-controlled paddle movement

Ball movement with dynamic direction handling

Collision detection (walls, paddle, bricks)

Brick destruction logic

Score tracking system

Win and Game Over conditions

Structured control flow using jumps and flags

🛠️ Technical Implementation

Written in x86 Assembly Language

Register-level programming

Manual collision detection logic

Interrupt handling for keyboard input

Direct screen output using BIOS/DOS interrupts

Efficient memory management and addressing

🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

Strong understanding of computer architecture

CPU register and flag manipulation

Low-level memory operations

Control flow using conditional branching

Game logic implementation without high-level abstractions

▶️ How to Run

Open the project in an assembler/emulator (e.g., EMU8086 / MASM / DOSBox).

Assemble and run the program.

Use keyboard controls to move the paddle and play.
